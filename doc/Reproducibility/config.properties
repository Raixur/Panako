################AUDIO#DECODER##############
#Decoding is either done via java or
# via a sub process of which the output
# is piped into Panako. The pipe should
# provide raw PCM, 44100Hz, 16bit.  
# To be able to use the pipe, libav, ffmpeg
# or a similar tool needs to be installed.
# Since decoding using such library is faster,
# more robust, better supported, and has more
# support for audio formats, it is advised
# to use a pipe.
# If Java is used, by default only audio already
# in the correct format is supported.
